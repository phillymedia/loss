<div class="subHead">Pat Killen, 76, Roxborough</div>
<p><strong>History:</strong> A former dietary clerk at Roxborough Memorial Hospital, she was widowed at 52 and "thought my life was over."&nbsp; She later dated an older man, but since his death has avoided romance. &nbsp;Depressed in retirement, she joined an exercise class at the Center at Journey's Way, her local senior center, and started taking trips.&nbsp; She has taken voice lessons, joined a church choir, and volunteered in a church bereavement program where she helped families plan funerals. &nbsp;She helps older seniors in her neighborhood who have trouble getting out. She started a walking group. She has met most of her good friends since 2010 and says the friendships are deeper than her earlier ones.&nbsp; "I am having the time of my life."</p>
<p><strong>Wisdom:</strong> Killen goes out of her way to try new things.&nbsp; "Older people have to fight it a little bit rather than settle in." She thinks virtual reality is "the coolest thing."</p>
<p>Helping people at the end of life, she said, gives her strength. "I have accepted the fact that each of us, our days are numbered and just whatever time that I have with these people, I would make the most out of it and enjoy," she said.&nbsp; "There's so much work to be done out there in the community.&nbsp; I want to do what I was put here on this world to do."</p>
<p>She feels blessed and busy.&nbsp; "God has just surrounded me with such friends and family.&nbsp; I love my life, and I'm going to live it. ... I would never trade places with the woman I was at 30."</p>

<div class="subHead">Young Bin Lee, 81, Medford/div>
<p><strong>History:&nbsp;</strong>Raised in both North and South Korea, Lee came to the U.S. for advanced medical training in 1964. He had planned to go back to Korea, but his wife, also a doctor, got cancer, and they stayed. She died in 2000. Two good friends died this year. He works four half-days a week as a neuropsychiatrist and is active in his church and Korean organizations.&nbsp; He loves opera.&nbsp; He has had heart surgery and a kidney transplant.&nbsp; His kidney came from his second wife, Eulie, whom he married 10 years ago.</p>
<p><strong>Wisdom: </strong>Asked about grief, Lee quoted a character from the opera Nabucco, who said, "Lord, give us the courage to endure suffering."&nbsp; Notice, Lee said, the character did not say, "Lord, do not give us any suffering."</p>
<p>Keeping busy and maintaining a younger mind-set help him live with loss.&nbsp; "I like to think I'm still in my 50s and 60s.&nbsp; At that age, you work hard. You take care of your children and you think about your grandchildren and try to study and learn more.&nbsp; That kind of lifestyle, I like that."</p>
<p>He keeps his eye on today. &nbsp;"I don't think about how long I'm going to live. I focus on now. I have no fear of dying, actually, but I will do my best until I die."</p>

<div class="subHead">Virginia Sale, 90, Rydal Park retirement community/div>
<p><strong>History: </strong>Sale was a Presbyterian minister like her husband.&nbsp; He died in 2015 of Alzheimer's disease. They had lived and worked together for almost 60 years. &nbsp;She has outlived most of her longtime friends.</p>
<p><strong>Wisdom:&nbsp;</strong>During her husband's nine-year illness, she learned to find positives, even in their suffering. "What I discovered was that, in this daily struggle for both of us, we learned how much we loved each other," she said.</p>
<p>After years of counseling others, Sale was surprised by how traumatic her husband's death felt. She realized she had lost a part of herself that had belonged to the marriage.&nbsp; "When that bond is broken, there is part of you that's missing, not just the loss of the person, the loss of the identity," &nbsp;she said.</p>
<p>At 90, she asked herself, " 'Well, Virginia, you're old. What are the possibilities?' ''</p>
<p>"A lot of life is a matter of stops and starts," she has learned, "and every time we grow."</p>
<p>She decided she would stop feeling sorry for herself. "Somewhere along the way you say, 'I am worth living for myself. ... I claim myself.' "</p>
<p>After her husband's death, she learned to make decisions for herself, without compromise. She redecorated. She plays bridge and works in the library.&nbsp; She takes walks.&nbsp; An introvert, a few friends are enough for her. She relishes the time she has to read. "I just love to learn," she said.</p>
<p>Is she happy? "I'm at peace," she said, "and that is the kind of happiness you can count on."</p>

<div class="subHead">Jettie Newkirk, 83, West Philadelphia</div>
<p><strong>History:</strong> She is a former high school teacher and counselor who became a lawyer, and is just easing out of her law practice now.&nbsp; An only child who never married, she has a daughter who looks out for her.&nbsp; Three of her four best friends have died; the lone survivor lives in California. Newkirk is having health problems. "The doctor officially told me the other day when I was there that I was falling apart, and I agreed with him," she said wryly.</p>
<p><strong>Wisdom:</strong> Newkirk is active in her church and sorority.&nbsp; She often eats Sunday dinner with a neighbor in her condo building.&nbsp; "People just take to me and appreciate my smile and my encouragement, and that gets me friends," she said. Over the years, she has mentored many young women who now treat her like a mother.&nbsp; "I've got a support system to be envied."</p>
<p>She is trying not to worry about money -- that shows a "lack of faith" -- and is learning to ask for and accept help.</p>
<p>She feels resilient and thankful. "Every day, there is something new for me to be grateful for," she said. "This year, I have noticed how beautiful the scenery is, the trees as they have been changing."</p>

<div class="containerPhotoCaption" alignment="true">Heshie Zinman, 67, left, mourns the loss of his best friend, Eddie Bomba, in the photograph, right, with his seeing eye dog ìCooperî, who died two years ago from cancer. Heshie Zinman is the founder of the LGBT Elder Initiative and has become an advocate for gay older adults. He lost a lot of friends during the early years of the AIDS epidemic and thought he would die himself when he found out he was HIV positive. Luckily, he got treatment that worked. He lost a very good friend a couple years ago. He had interesting things to say about finding purpose and living with the specter of death. He keeps photos of his friend who died.</div>

<div class="subHead">Heshie Zinman, 67, Center City/div>
<p><strong>History</strong>: Cofounder of &nbsp;the LGBT Elder Initiative, he became an activist and advocate during the early days of the AIDS epidemic. &nbsp;&nbsp;He learned he was HIV-positive in 1989 and assumed he would die before long.&nbsp; New treatments have kept the virus at bay.&nbsp; His parents died when he was 24, a loss that left him with a sense of "profound vulnerability." Coming just a few years later, the AIDS epidemic was devastating.&nbsp; "I had like 16 close friends -- we were a whole social group -- who died. They were horrible losses. It was not pretty."&nbsp; His best friend died two years ago, at age 62.</p>
<p><strong>Wisdom: </strong>When grief from the AIDS crisis hit him, he remembered what he had learned after his parents died.&nbsp; "I was so fortunate to have known my mother and father for as long as I did, and I was so fortunate to know these friends," he said. "I had my memories and that got me through some really hard times." He and his husband of six years supported each other when their friend died recently.&nbsp; "That was a comfort."</p>
<p>He's active in his synagogue and the community. "I'm always out there meeting people," he said.&nbsp; He urges people who are lonely to volunteer or take part in politics.&nbsp; "There are so many things that you can do to stay involved in the world, and you just have to do it."</p>
<p>Nothing takes away the pain of loss, he said, but you can suffer less.</p>
<p>"You never can exhaust that process of minimizing what is not important and looking at things that really matter," he said.</p>
<p>Zinman makes a point of telling people how much he cares for them. Death or disease could come at any time.&nbsp; "I just know that it could be tomorrow. It could be at any moment.&nbsp; What's important is this moment. Right now. Today.&nbsp; Try and do good."</p>

<div class="subHead">Caroline Wroblewski, 75, Normandy Farms Estates, a retirement community in Blue Bell/div>
<p><strong>History:</strong> She retired at 70 as director of a counseling and treatment program for women in Washington, D.C. Never married, she has lost a sister and moved to be near her brother.&nbsp; Close friends have moved to Texas and Massachusetts. She counts leaving her beloved condo near Washington as a loss. She volunteers with hospice patients.</p>
<p><strong>Wisdom:&nbsp;</strong>Wroblewski is clear-eyed about her mortality now that she is well past the halfway point in her life.&nbsp; "I am healthy, but I know I've lived longer than I'm going to live."&nbsp;&nbsp; Her deepest friendships are those established long ago, but she is forming strong relationships at Normandy Farms, too.&nbsp; One, Pat, is in her late 80s.&nbsp; They do jigsaw puzzles and water aerobics together.&nbsp; "I am coming to love Pat.&nbsp; She's one of my trusted friends here. ... Granted, she is at the end of her life, but she's very alive in the moment."</p>
<p>One of her hospice patients was 89 and able to communicate only with her eyes.&nbsp; The day before she died, Wroblewski told her: "I just want you to know it's been a joy working with you, being with you.&nbsp; I believe you're already in the hands of God." Wroblewski felt lucky to have had time with her.&nbsp; "I learned the most from her.&nbsp; She was just a gracious receiver.&nbsp; She had no complaints.&nbsp; She enjoyed the moment."</p>
<p>Wroblewski treasures hearing the stories of older residents. "They're my mentors right now.&nbsp; They're in places where I have yet to go, and they're helping me choose how I want to go there."</p>

<div class="subHead">Thelma Reese, 85, Bella Vista neighborhood of Philadelphia</div>
<p><strong>History:&nbsp;</strong>A retired professor of English and education, she coauthored The New Senior Woman and The New Senior Man&nbsp;and is working on another book about seniors.</p>
<p><strong>Wisdom:</strong> She's a believer in "doing things that take you out of yourself enough to widen your horizon a little" to improve mental health and prevent focus on the physical problems of old age.</p>
<p>It's tough to lose old friends, either from death or growing apart. "You feel like you're losing part of your history when they go." New friends can listen to your stories, but you haven't "lived and breathed it together."</p>
<p>She is "extremely" conscious of her mortality and has been reading about psychologist Erik Erikson's stages of development.&nbsp; His last stage (65 and up) is the age of integrity or despair.&nbsp; That resonates with Reese.&nbsp; Once you have a "sense of an ending," she said, "it can either make you despair or make you think: 'I've got to do something. I've got to get it done somehow.' "</p>
<p>Interviewing other seniors who are leading active lives helps her open up.&nbsp; "I'm interested in these people because they're doing things I'm not.&nbsp; I admire them.&nbsp; I find it encouraging that they're in the world."</p>
